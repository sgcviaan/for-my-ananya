  "summary": "REQ-12 is largely implemented: a new OurLittleComparisonSection component is created, integrated into App.tsx, has a soft rounded frame, subtle shadow, hover zoom animation, and the poetic caption. However, the image source used in the component points to '/assets/generated/comparison.dim_930x1240.jpg' rather than '/assets/comparison.jpg' as required by the acceptance criteria. The static asset file itself (frontend/public/assets/comparison.jpg) does not appear in the diff as an added file, so it may not have been committed.",
