# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add the uploaded arms comparison photo to the "Our Little Comparison 🤍" section of the "For My Ananya" app.

**Planned changes:**
- Save the lightly warmed and soft-focused version of pic.jpeg as `frontend/public/assets/comparison.jpg`
- Display the image in the "Our Little Comparison 🤍" section inside a soft rounded frame with subtle shadow
- Add a gentle hover zoom animation to the image
- Show the existing poetic caption below the image

**User-visible outcome:** The "Our Little Comparison 🤍" section now displays the arms photo in a styled rounded frame with shadow and hover zoom, followed by the poetic caption.
